So I found a scenario today where we had two different `PropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer` beans declared in two separate XML files. Unfortunately, the second property file wasnâ€™t getting loaded, so we would get errors about Spring being unable to resolve particular properties.

I found this great post summarizing the solution:

Basically, you have to update the definition for the first `PropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer` bean that gets loaded and add the `ignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders` property:

{% codeblock lang:xml %}
<bean id="mailProps" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
         <property name="location" value="classpath:mail.properties"/>
         <property name="ignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders" value="true"/>
</bean>	
{% endcodeblock %}
